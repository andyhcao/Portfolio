# [Project 1: PetFinder.my - Pawpularity Contest](https://github.com/andyhcao/Pawpularity-Contest.git)
- The objective of this project is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photograph for that profile using the "Pawpularity Score".
- The Pawpularity Score is derived from each pet profile's page view statistics at the listing pages, using an algorithm that normalizes the traffic data across different pages, platforms (web & mobile) and various metrics.
- Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and ultimately, used a linear model to predict. 

# [Project 2: Covid 19 Death Predictions](https://github.com/andyhcao/Covid-19-Death-Predictions)
- The objective of this project is to predict the weekly number of deaths caused by Covid 19 based on statistics during the previous week. 
- Performed data analysis, some feature engineering and used AutoML to create a model.
- Obtained a RMSE score of 695.32135.

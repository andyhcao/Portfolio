# [Project 1: PetFinder.my - Pawpularity Contest](https://github.com/andyhcao/Pawpularity-Contest.git)
- The objective of this project is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photograph for that profile using the "Pawpularity Score".
- The Pawpularity Score is derived from each pet profile's page view statistics at the listing pages, using an algorithm that normalizes the traffic data across different pages, platforms (web & mobile) and various metrics.
- Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and ultimately, used a linear model to predict.
